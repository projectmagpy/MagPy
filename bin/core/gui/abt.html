    <p>
MagPy is a Web data Extraction and processing tool that aims at enhancing the web search experience of users. It is developed by a team of three students from RSET
</p>
<p>
Combining the power of popular search engines like Google, Yahoo and Bing, powerful frameworks and tools for web data extractions and processing, we aim at building a powerful tool that works similar to a new search engine. Providing capabilities to filter search results using various constraints, watch website updates and automate web based activities, this project aims at changing the way users search for content in the web.
</p>
<p>
The app and accompanying web service will be offered for PC and Android users and will be released soon.
